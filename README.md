# Twelve-Tone-Calculator
This program generates and manipulates matrices based on dodecaphonic (12-tone) series â€” a technique used in serial music composition. It allows users to create tone rows and apply standard transformations such as inversion, retrograde, and retrograde inversion for analytical and compositional purposes.

## Usage
- Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your device.
- Open the source code and modify the `series` list to define your custom 12-tone row.  
  A comment in the code will help you locate where to make the change.
